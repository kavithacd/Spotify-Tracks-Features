# Spotify-Tracks-Features
Trying to Predict Popularity of Spotify Tracks using their features (Comparison of Ensembles Methods: Boosting methods and Random Forest).
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation.
Experimented with Features (Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction).
Built and tested predictive models such as Linear Regression (worst performing), Random Forest (with feature importance), Random forest using reduced number of features (through feature importance from previous run), Baggin, AdaBoost, AdaBoost with hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost and Light GBM models.
